## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities very seriously. If you discover a security issue in HumorVault-Joke-Delivery-ReactNative-Mobile-App, please report it to us following these steps:

1.  **DO NOT** disclose the vulnerability publicly. Please report it privately to us first.
2.  Send an email to `chirag.127@example.com` (replace with actual contact if available) with the subject line `Security Vulnerability Report - [Your Finding]`. Please include as much of the following information as possible:
    *   The type of vulnerability (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, SQL Injection, etc.).
    *   The affected component or feature.
    *   Detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
    *   The impact of the vulnerability.
    *   Any recommended mitigation or remediation steps.
    *   Your contact information.
3.  We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and will make a reasonable effort to address the vulnerability promptly. We will also provide a timeline for remediation and potential public disclosure.

## Security Practices

We strive to follow industry best practices to ensure the security of our codebase:

*   **Dependency Management:** We regularly review and update our project dependencies using package managers like npm/yarn to incorporate security patches. Automated dependency scanning is integrated into our CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Code Audits:** We perform code reviews with a focus on security considerations.
*   **Linting and Static Analysis:** Tools are used to identify potential security flaws and enforce coding standards.
*   **Secure Development Lifecycle:** Security considerations are integrated into all stages of the development process.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Components and user roles are designed with minimal necessary permissions.

## Disclosure

We aim to be transparent about security issues. Once a vulnerability is confirmed and a fix is developed, we will:

*   Inform the reporter of the status.
*   Release a patched version of the application.
*   Consider a coordinated public disclosure, often through GitHub Security Advisories, after the fix has been deployed and is widely available.

Thank you for helping to keep HumorVault-Joke-Delivery-ReactNative-Mobile-App secure!
